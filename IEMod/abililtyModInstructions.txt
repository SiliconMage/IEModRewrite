To augment a specific ability, you will have to add entries to the file "abiltyMods.json."  If this file does not exist, you can simply create it in the root IEMod directory.

By default, your "abilityMods.json" file will be blank.  To include an ability, you will want to add it to the "moddedAbilities" collection.  Abilties will match on name, so be sure to double-check the name of the ability in game if your mod isn't working.  For non-English versions of the game, use the non-English name of ability.  However the ability is displayed in game, is however you should use as the name in the file.

In addition to the Name property, you will also have access to the following properties:

 * MinimumDamage - The lowest amount of damage the ability can deal
 * MaximumDamage - The highest amount of damage the ability can deal
 * AccuracyBonus - A bonus to accuracy when the ability is used
 * Range - How far away from the target the ability can be used without having to move closer, or how far the ability's attack will travel
 * DTBypass - An amount of damage from the ability that will ignore Damage Reduction
 * Speed - How fast the ability executes.  Valid options are: 0,1,2.  These represent Instant, Short or Long
 * Push - How far the targets of the ability are pushed on being hit
 * DefendedBy - Which stat the ability is resisted by.  Valid options are: Deflect, Fortitude, Reflex, Will and None
 * BlastRadius - Only for abilities with AoE.  The radius of the area of effect.  The bigger the radius, the more area the ability will affect.
 * BlastAngle - The angle in degrees the AoE will affect. 360 is a full circle, while 180 is a half-circle.
 * Modal - Whether or not the ability is a modal ability
 * UseType - How often the ability recharges its uses.  Valid options are: None, PerEncounter, PerRest, Charged, PerStrongholdTurn
 * Uses - The number of uses the ability has before it has to be recharged
 * StatusEffectMods - Modifies the status effects of an ability.  The status effect mod has two properties: Value and Duration. Value will typically modify how much of the status effect something does, while Duration is how long that status effect will last.  Sometimes, an ability has multiple status effects.  To target a specific status effect, you will have to add empty status effect mods before the status effect you want to target.
 * MainCharacterOnly - Modifies the ability only for the main character
 * PartyMembersOnly - Modifies the ability only for party members, main character included
 * DurationOverride - Overrides the duration for specific abilities where the duration override is set, such as for Bulwark Against the Elements.  If you have tried using the StatusEffectMods property to increase the duration of an ability, and that didn't take, try using this property insteead.

To not modify a property of an ability, simply omit it from the list of properties.  Below is an example of modifying some abilities in the game:
