To augment a specific ability, you will have to add entries to the file "abiltyMods.json."  Doing this is fairly straight-forward.

By default, your "abilityMods.json" file will be blank.  To include an ability, you will want to add it to the "moddedAbilities" collection.  Abilties will match on name, so be sure to double-check the name of the ability in game if your mod isn't working.

In addition to the Name property, you will also have access to the following properties:

 * MinimumDamage - The lowest amount of damage the ability can deal
 * MaximumDamage - The highest amount of damage the ability can deal
 * AccuracyBonus - A bonus to accuracy when the ability is used
 * Range - How far away from the target the ability can be used without having to move closer, or how far the ability's attack will travel
 * DTBypass - An amount of damage from the ability that will ignore Damage Reduction
 * Speed - How fast the ability executes.  Valid options are: 0,1,2.  These represent Instant, Short or Long
 * Push - How far the targets of the ability are pushed on being hit
 * DefendedBy - Which stat the ability is resisted by.  Valid options are: Deflect, Fortitude, Reflex, Will and None
 * BlastRadius - Only for abilities with AoE.  The radius of the area of effect.  The bigger the radius, the more area the ability will affect.
 * BlastAngle - The angle in degrees the AoE will affect. 360 is a full circle, while 180 is a half-circle.
 * Modal - Whether or not the ability is a modal ability
 * UseType - How often the ability recharges its uses.  Valid options are: None, PerEncounter, PerRest, Charged, PerStrongholdTurn
 * Uses - The number of uses the ability has before it has to be recharged

To not modify a prroperty of an ability, simply omit it from the list of properties.  Below is an example of modifying some abilities in the game:
